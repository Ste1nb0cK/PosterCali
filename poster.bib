	abstract = {The estimation of parameters characterizing dynamical processes is central to science and technology. The estimation error changes with the number N of resources employed in the experiment (which could quantify, for instance, the number of probes or the probing energy). Typically, it scales as . Quantum strategies may improve the precision, for noiseless processes, by an extra factor . For noisy processes, it is not known in general if and when this improvement can be achieved. Here we propose a general framework for obtaining attainable and useful lower bounds for the ultimate limit of precision in noisy systems. We apply this bound to lossy optical interferometry and atomic spectroscopy in the presence of dephasing, showing that it captures the main features of the transition from the 1/N to the behaviour as N increases, independently of the initial state of the probes, and even with use of adaptive feedback.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.0804.2981},
	abstract = {Several quantities of interest in quantum information, including entanglement and purity, are nonlinear functions of the density matrix and cannot, even in principle, correspond to proper quantum observables. Any method aimed to determine the value of these quantities should resort to indirect measurements and thus corresponds to a parameter estimation problem whose solution, i.e the determination of the most precise estimator, unavoidably involves an optimization procedure. We review local quantum estimation theory and present explicit formulas for the symmetric logarithmic derivative and the quantum Fisher information of relevant families of quantum states. Estimability of a parameter is defined in terms of the quantum signal-to-noise ratio and the number of measurements needed to achieve a given relative error. The connections between the optmization procedure and the geometry of quantum statistical models are discussed. Our analysis allows to quantify quantum noise in the measurements of non observable quantities and provides a tools for the characterization of signals and devices in quantum technology.},

	abstract = {Quantum metrology pursues the physical realization of higher-precision measurements to physical quantities than the classically achievable limit by exploiting quantum features, such as quantum entanglement and squeezing, as resources. It has potential applications in developing next-generation frequency standards, magnetometers, radar, and navigation. However, the ubiquitous decoherence in the quantum world degrades the quantum resources and forces the precision back to or even worse than the classical limit, which is called the no-go theorem of noisy quantum metrology and greatly hinders its applications. Therefore, how to realize the promised performance of quantum metrology in realistic noisy situations attracts much attention in recent years. We will review the principle, categories, and applications of quantum metrology. Special attention will be paid to different quantum resources that can bring quantum superiority in enhancing the sensitivity. Then, we will introduce the no-go theorem of noisy quantum metrology and its active control under different kinds of noise-induced decoherence situations.},

Unlike the optimal Gaussian probes, which can attain the ultimate bound on precision asymptotically either for very small or very large losses, we prove that Fock states at any fixed photon number saturate the bound unconditionally for any value of the loss. In the relevant regime of low-energy probes, we demonstrate that superpositions of the first low-lying Fock states yield an absolute improvement over any Gaussian probe. Such few-photon states can be recast quite generally as truncations of de-Gaussified photon-subtracted states.},

	abstract = {We address the characterization of dissipative bosonic channels and show that estimation of the loss rate by Gaussian probes (coherent or squeezed) is improved in the presence of Kerr nonlinearity. In particular, enhancement of precision may be substantial for short interaction time, i.e., for media of moderate size, e.g., biological samples. We analyze in detail the behavior of the quantum Fisher information ({QFI}), and determine the values of nonlinearity maximizing the {QFI} as a function of the interaction time and of the parameters of the input signal. We also discuss the precision achievable by photon counting and quadrature measurement and present additional results for truncated, few-photon, probe signals. Finally, we discuss the origin of the precision enhancement, showing that it cannot be linked quantitatively to the non-Gaussianity or the nonclassicality of the interacting probe signal.},
